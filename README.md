## Instructions

- In `HomeEnergyApi/Models/HomeRepository`
  - Create a new method `IsHomeNull()` taking one argument of type `Home?`
    - If the `Home?` argument is null, the method should return true
    - Otherwise, the method should return false

## Additional Information

- Do not remove or modify anything in `HomeEnergyApi.Tests`
- Some Models may have changed for this lesson from the last, as always all code in the lesson repository is available to view
- Along with `using` statements being added, any packages needed for the assignment have been pre-installed for you, however in the future you may need to add these yourself
