## Lecture

## Instructions

- In `HomeEnergyApi/Models/HomeRepository`
  - Create a new method `IsHomeNull()` taking one argument of type `Home?`
    - If the `Home?` argument is null, the method should return true
    - Otherwise, the method should return false

## Additional Information

- Do not remove or modify anything in `HomeEnergyApi.Tests`
- Some Models may have changed for this lesson from the last, as always all code in the lesson repository is available to view
- Along with `using` statements being added, any packages needed for the assignment have been pre-installed for you, however in the future you may need to add these yourself

## Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects (3A-AP-17) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Create artifacts by using procedures within a program, combinations of data and procedures, or independent but interrelated programs (3A-AP-18) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects (3B-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Demonstrate code reuse by creating programming solutions using libraries and APIs (3B-AP-16) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Use lists to simplify solutions, generalizing computational problems instead of repeatedly using simple variables (3A-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Create computational models that represent the relationships among different elements of data collected from a phenomenon or process (3A-DA-12) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
